namespace boost { namespace hana {
    //! @ingroup group-core
    //! Namespace containing operators provided as an alias to some methods.
    //!
    //! Some methods provide equivalent ways of being called by using
    //! operators, which are sometimes more expressive. Those operators
    //! are contained in the namespace `boost::hana::operators`. In all
    //! cases, the operators must be explicitly asked for in order to be
    //! enabled for objects of a data type. Exactly how to do this is
    //! documented by `operators::of`. However, unary and binary operators
    //! are handled a bit differently, as is explained next.
    //!
    //! For a unary operator `@` aliasing a method `m` and an argument
    //! of a data type `T`, the operator is enabled only when
    //! `has_operator<T, decltype(m)>` is true. For a binary operator `@`
    //! aliasing a method `m` and two arguments of data type `T` and `U`,
    //! the operator is enabled when either `has_operator<T, decltype(m)>`
    //! or `has_operator<U, decltype(m)>` is true.
    //!
    //! To use the operators in this namespace, one may either use
    //! `operators::adl` or make them visible to name lookup by importing
    //! them all explicitly
    //! @code
    //!     using namespace boost::hana::operators;
    //! @endcode
    //! or by importing them selectively
    //! @code
    //!     using boost::hana::operators::operator+;
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //!
    //! Example
    //! -------
    //! @include example/core/operators.cpp
    namespace operators {
        //! @ingroup group-core
        //! Makes the operators from `boost::hana::operators` visible to ADL.
        //!
        //! Given a type `T`, the operators in `boost::hana::operators` can
        //! be made usable with objects of type `T` in two different ways.
        //! First, making `operators::adl` a base class of the type `T` will
        //! add the `hana::operators` namespace to the set of associated
        //! namespaces that are considered during argument dependent lookup,
        //! which has the effect of making those operators available for
        //! objects of type `T`. Otherwise, using `operators::adl` as a
        //! template parameter of a template will also achieve the same
        //! effect. For example, if one has a template type `T` declared as
        //! @code
        //!     template <typename ...>
        //!     struct T;
        //! @endcode
        //! , using `operators::adl` as a template parameter will cause
        //! `T<..., operators::adl, ...>` to have the `hana::operators`
        //! namespace in its set of associated namespaces for ADL.
        //!
        //! While `operators::adl` makes the operators visible to lookup for
        //! the objects of a type, it is still required to enable them
        //! explicitly with `operators::of`.
        //!
        //!
        //! Example
        //! -------
        //! @include example/core/operators.cpp
        struct adl { };

        //! @ingroup group-core
        //! Controls the operator aliases that are enabled for a data type.
        //!
        //! Given a data type `T`, `operators::of<T>` should inherit from all
        //! the methods whose operator aliases are enabled for objects of data
        //! type `T`. The methods inherited by this trait are checked by
        //! `has_operator`; if `operators::of<T>` inherits from `decltype(m)`
        //! for some method `m`, then `has_operator<T, decltype(m)>` will
        //! be true.
        //!
        //! Additionally, if the data type `T` wants to use all the operators
        //! provided by some concept `C`, having `operators::of<T>` inherit
        //! `operators::of<C>` is sufficient.
        //!
        //! While explicit specialization of `operators::of` is possible,
        //! another way of customizing this trait is provided. If `T` (or a
        //! concept, see below) provides a nested `hana::operators` type,
        //! then `operators::of<T>` will inherit this instead. This makes
        //! it possible to enable operators for a data type or concept
        //! without ever leaving the comfort of your namespace.
        //!
        //! When a concept `Concept` has methods for which equivalent
        //! operators are provided, `operators::of<Concept>` should be
        //! specialized so it inherits from all its methods that possess an
        //! operator equivalent. For example, if `Concept` has methods `m1`,
        //! `m2` and `m3`, and if `m1` and `m2` have associated operators in
        //! the `hana::operators` namespace, then `Concept` should specialize
        //! `operators::of` as follows, or provide an equivalent
        //! `hana::operators` member type:
        //! @code
        //!     template <>
        //!     struct operators::of<Concept>
        //!         : decltype(m1), decltype(m2)
        //!     { };
        //! @endcode
        //!
        //! Hence, if a data type `T` wants to enable all the operators
        //! provided by `Concept`, `operators::of<T>` only needs to inherit
        //! `operators::of<Concept>`:
        //! @code
        //!     template <>
        //!     struct operators::of<T>
        //!         : operators::of<Concept>
        //!     { };
        //! @endcode
        //! instead of writing the following code, which is otherwise
        //! equivalent:
        //! @code
        //!     template <>
        //!     struct operators::of<T>
        //!         : decltype(m1), decltype(m2)
        //!     { };
        //! @endcode
        //!
        //! Also, given more than a single concept, `operators::of` will
        //! behave as
        //! @code
        //!     template <typename ...Concepts>
        //!     struct operators
        //!         : operators<Concepts>...
        //!     { };
        //! @endcode
        //! This makes it possible for a data type `T` to enable the operators
        //! provided by several concepts easily. For example, if `T` wants to
        //! enable the operators provided by concepts `C1`, `C2` and `C3`, the
        //! `operators::of` specialization only needs to look like:
        //! @code
        //!     template <>
        //!     struct operators::of<T>
        //!         : operators::of<C1, C2, C3>
        //!     { };
        //! @endcode
        //!
        //! instead of the following code, which is otherwise equivalent:
        //! @code
        //!     template <>
        //!     struct operators::of<T>
        //!         : operators::of<C1>, operators::of<C2>, operators::of<C3>
        //!     { };
        //! @endcode
        //!
        //!
        //! @note
        //! This trait only controls which operators are enabled when they
        //! are found by name lookup. To make the operators findable by name
        //! lookup, one should use `operators::adl` or import the operators
        //! from the `operators` namespace explicitly.
        //!
        //! @warning
        //! If a data type enables the operator for a method or a concept
        //! that is not implemented or modeled by that data type, the
        //! behavior is undefined. In particular, one will probably end
        //! up with a ugly and hard to understand compiler error. The reason
        //! for that is that some methods like `equal` are defined for objects
        //! that are `EqualityComparable`, i.e. that can be compared using
        //! `==`. To do this, `equal` has to test whether the `x == y`
        //! expression is valid. If a data type enables the `==` operator
        //! provided by Comparable but does not define the `equal` method,
        //! and if the `==` operator is accessible through ADL for objects
        //! of that data type, then `equal` will get caught in the loop when
        //! trying to check whether `x == y` is a valid expression.
        //! Bottom line: don't do this.
        //!
        //!
        //! Example
        //! -------
        //! @include example/core/operators.cpp
#ifdef BOOST_HANA_DOXYGEN_INVOKED
        template <see documentation>
        struct of;

#endif
    } // end namespace operators

    //! @ingroup group-core
    //! Returns whether the operator associated to a given method is enabled
    //! for the given data type.
    //!
    //! Given a data type `T` and the type `decltype(m)` of a method `m`,
    //! `has_operator` returns whether `m` has an operator associated to it
    //! and whether that operator is enabled for objects of data typeÂ `T`,
    //! as documented by `operators::of`.
    //!
    //!
    //! Example

    //! @include example/core/operators.cpp
